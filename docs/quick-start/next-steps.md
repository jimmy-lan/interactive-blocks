# Next Steps

InteractiveBlocks.js is probably much more complex than you would initially think.
This is why it allows lots of customizations and opens for extension.
I designed InteractiveBlocks.js so that it not only starts out very easy, but also allows you to customize the library to a premium level.

To learn more about the library, visit the [API documentation](api-docs/base-classes/attribute-registry.md). You may also find some [guides/examples](guides/multiple-choice.md) on how to use InteractiveBlocks.js helpful.
