# Build an API Sync Plugin

InteractiveBlocks.js is a scalable and highly flexible library.
Parts of components in InteractiveBlocks.js can be substituted to trigger different behaviours.
To demonstrate this point to you, we will substitute the `persistence` part of components so that they save data to an API endpoint in this guide.

Learn more about the library: [BlockModel](base-classes/block-model.md), [BlockComponent](/base-classes/block-component.md), [Attribute Registry](base-classes/attribute-registry.md), [Event Registry](base-classes/event-registry.md), [Persistence](base-classes/persistence.md), [Collection](base-classes/collection.md), [Collection Component](base-classes/collection-component.md).
